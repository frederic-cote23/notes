Zcash has two kinds of address: a z-addr is a fully private address that uses the zero-knowledge proving system to shield a transaction and balance privacy. A t-addr (aka "transparent address") is similar to a Bitcoin address.

An address can be created using:

zcash-cli getnewaddress    # t-addr, or
zcash-cli z_getnewaddress  # z-addr
t-addr is a 36 characters long string beginning with t.

z-addr has 96 characters and starts with z.
